This program takes a given stock photo and edits in a transparent ghost anywhere on the screen given coordinates.

The stock pictures used to create the three "ghost" images were created by Marcus Ranum. He has graciously granted permission for anyone to use his stock provided he is given credit as the photographer. His website can be found at www.ranum.com.

The photos used for the background images are in the public domain.
Tested On:

*Note Python and pygame need to be installed

To run execute in a command prompt
>python3 Ghost_Image_Editor.py

Issues:
